Welcome to iPOPO's documentation. This documentation is divided in
three main parts.
The :ref:`quickstart` will guide you to install iPOPO and write your
first components.
The :ref:`concepts` section details the various concepts of iPOPO.
Finally, the :ref:`tutorials` explain how to use the various built-in
services of iPOPO.
You can also take a look to the slides of the
`iPOPO tutorial <https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo-tutorials/releases>`_
to have a quick overview of iPOPO.

This documentation is inspired from
`Flask's one <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.

iPOPO depends on a fork of `jsonrpclib`_, called `jsonrpclib-pelix`_.
The documentation of this library is available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/tcalmant/jsonrpclib>`_.
