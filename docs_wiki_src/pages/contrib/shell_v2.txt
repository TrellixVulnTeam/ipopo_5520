====== Pelix shell v2 ======

The current Pelix shell begins to show its limits, so a new version must be drafted.
Here are the changes and new features that would be nice to have in the next version.

===== Variables =====

It would be nice to support variables in the shell, like:

<code>
$ set var="some.value"
$ echo $var
some.value
$ install $var
42
$ unset $var
$ echo $var

$
</code>


===== Sessions =====

Sessions would wrap the I/O Handler that is used to communicate with the client.
It would contain the session dictionary to store variables.

The session object would replace the I/O handler parameter in shell command, with full support of the previous API.


===== Script files =====

More a command than a feature, it should be possible to run a Pelix shell script file:
<code>
$ run installer.pelix
</code>


===== Result value =====

Like in Unix shell, it would be interesting to keep the result of the last command in a variable, like ``$?``.
This would allow to have script files like:

<code>
install sample.bundle
start $?
echo Installed bundle $?
</code>

This could then used in a script file:
<code>
$ run script.pelix
Installed bundle 43
</code>
