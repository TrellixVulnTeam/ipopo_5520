====== Road map ======

This road map is given as an indication of the future features of iPOPO, but it might not be fully respected.
Feel free to post feature requests or contributions on [[https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo/issues?state=open|GitHub]] or on the [[http://groups.google.com/group/ipopo-users|users mailing list]].
You can take a look to the [[ipopo:workinprogress|]] page to see what I am currently working on.
